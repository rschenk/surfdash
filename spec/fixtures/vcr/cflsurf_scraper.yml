        OutlookText = "<p><b> Aug 16 (Sun) - </b> It doesn't look like we will be surfing much this weekend or the coming week either. Very small surf (0 to lucky 2 foot range) continues with no end in sight. There are some small storms building off the coast of Africa in the cane corridor, but nothing significant yet. I added the link to a new buoy located about 1/2 mile off shore from the Melb Boardwalk. I called it the 1/2-mile buoy. The link is in the Surf Forecast box. Most of you will want to see the Indialantic buoy, but there is also a buoy off Jensen Beach.
